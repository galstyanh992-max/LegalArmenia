---

## 1. Frontend Completeness — READY ✅

13 complete pages fully implemented: Dashboard, Login, Cases, KnowledgeBase, Admin, Calendar, Transcriptions, MyDocuments, and others. All routes wired in `App.tsx` with proper `ProtectedRoute` guards and role-based access. No TODO/placeholder stubs found in core routing.

Dashboard is fully functional — multi-tab UI, case management, chat, AI analysis. Not a prototype.

9 heavy pages are lazy-loaded (Dashboard, CaseDetail, Calendar, KB, Admin, etc.) via `React.lazy + Suspense` with `PageLoader` fallback.

---

## 2. Performance & PWA — READY ✅

Vite build optimization with code splitting configured. TanStack React Query with 5-minute staleTime, retry=1, no window refocus. VitePWA with Workbox: Supabase API cached 1 hour (50-entry cache), network-first strategy with 5s timeout fallback. App is installable on mobile — strong differentiator for field-use lawyers.

---

## 3. Multi-tenancy & Data Isolation — READY ✅

Teams table with team leader + member model. RLS enabled on all critical tables. Role-based access enforced by Supabase policies (users see own data, lawyers see assigned case data, admins see all). Audit logs track mutations with user_id, action, timestamp. Soft-delete pattern preserves audit trail. Multiple law firms can operate as independent teams on one instance.

---

## 4. Deployment & Infrastructure — READY ✅

Supabase fully configured. 185 migrations applied — complete schema. 1 GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow runs tests on push/PR. 50+ operational scripts in `/scripts/`. No automated deployment pipeline (manual via deployment UI or git push) — acceptable at this stage.

---

## 5. Error Handling & Stability — NEEDS_WORK ⚠️

**No global React ErrorBoundary** — one unhandled exception crashes the entire session. Individual try-catch blocks exist (200+) but no application-level safety net.

8 instances of bare `.catch(() => {})` in edge functions — silent failures with no logging. 173 `console.log/warn` statements in edge functions — operational noise in Supabase logs, inconsistent with `safe-logger.ts`.

TypeScript safety: 8 `as any` suppressions in hooks alone, 39 total in frontend per Task 06 audit.

---

## 6. Documentation — NEEDS_WORK ⚠️

- User manual exists (`USER_MANUAL.md` — 14KB, basic coverage)
- System prompts documented (`SYSTEM_PROMPTS.md`, `SYSTEM_PROMPTS_EN.md`)
- Audit reports exist (`AUDIT_REPORTS/`)
- **Missing:** API documentation (no OpenAPI/Swagger spec)
- **Missing:** Deployment runbook (no step-by-step go-live guide)
- **Missing:** SLA/uptime documentation
- **Missing:** Disaster recovery / backup procedures
- **Missing:** Admin onboarding guide for law firm admins

---

## 7. Testing Coverage — NEEDS_WORK ⚠️

Only 12 test files across the entire codebase (8 component tests, 4 utility/edge function tests). GitHub Actions runs `npm run test` + `deno test` on push.

**No coverage for core business logic** — legal-chat, ai-analyze, multi-agent-analyze, generate-complaint are untested. **No E2E tests** (no Cypress/Playwright). **No load/stress tests**. **No visual regression tests**.

---

## 8. Monitoring & Observability — NOT_READY ❌

Zero error tracking integration — no Sentry, LogRocket, Datadog, or equivalent. No uptime monitoring. No application performance monitoring (APM). No real-time alerting for failures. 173 console logs exist but no aggregation or structured search.

In production, any system failure will be invisible until users report it.

---

## 9. Pricing & Billing — NOT_READY ❌

**This is the primary commercial blocker.**

- No subscription/billing UI in application
- No Stripe or payment processor integration
- No pricing page or plan selection
- No usage-based billing implementation

Cost tracking was broken (BUG-C1, BUG-C2 — fixed in Task 07), but there is no business layer to monetize usage even now. No monthly spend caps by subscription tier. No invoice generation.

Without billing, this is a functional product that cannot generate revenue.

---

## 10. Legal Compliance UI — NOT_READY ❌

- **No privacy policy page or component**
- **No terms of service page or component**
- **No GDPR/PDPA compliance UI** (no right to erasure, no data export UI)
- **No cookie consent banner**
- **No "Delete My Account" workflow** (export-data edge function exists but no UI)
- **No data retention policy implementation**

Armenian law and EU data protection requirements mandate these for any commercial data processor. Absence of these creates legal liability for the operator.

---

## Top 5 Blockers for Commercial Launch

**1. No billing system.** No subscription/payment UI, no Stripe integration, no pricing tiers. Cannot monetize. Estimated effort: 4–6 weeks.

**2. No legal compliance framework.** No privacy policy, ToS, GDPR/PDPA data deletion UI, cookie consent. Creates legal liability before first customer. Estimated effort: 3–4 weeks (including legal review).

**3. Zero error tracking / monitoring.** No Sentry or equivalent. Cannot detect or diagnose production incidents. Operational blind spot. Estimated effort: 1–2 weeks.

**4. No global error boundary.** One unhandled React error crashes the entire user session with no recovery path. Estimated effort: 1–2 days.

**5. No E2E tests for core workflows.** Legal-chat, AI analysis, document generation — the platform's core value — are untested in CI. Any regression goes undetected. Estimated effort: 3–4 weeks (Playwright/Cypress setup + core test cases).

---

## Top 5 Differentiators / Strengths

**1. Comprehensive Armenian legal AI.** Multi-agent analysis, evidence aggregation, complaint drafting, RAG over RA legislation and Cassation Court precedents — unique product in the RA market.

**2. Strong prompt security.** Legal-chat and ai-analyze have robust injection defenses (prompt-armor, PII redaction, secureSandbox). Security is better than most legal AI products.

**3. Enterprise-grade database design.** 185 migrations, RLS on all tables, soft-delete, audit logs, multi-tenancy. The data model is production-ready.

**4. PWA + offline capability.** Installable on mobile with Workbox caching. Works on slow or intermittent connections — critical for Armenian legal professionals in field settings.

**5. Multi-language ready.** i18n for Armenian, Russian, English. System prompts in multiple languages. Ready for regional expansion beyond RA.

## Recommended Go-Live Path

### Phase 1: CRITICAL — Commercial Foundation (6–8 weeks)
Must complete before any paying customer:
1. Implement billing (Stripe + subscription tiers + usage limits)
2. Add privacy policy, ToS, GDPR/PDPA data deletion, cookie consent
3. Integrate Sentry (error tracking + alerting)
4. Add global React ErrorBoundary
5. Fix remaining HIGH bugs from Task 08 (prompt armor in multi-agent, Telegram webhook)

### Phase 2: IMPORTANT — Stability (3–4 weeks, parallel or immediately after)
6. E2E tests for legal-chat, ai-analyze, document generation (Playwright)
7. Structured logging aggregation (replace console.log with safe-logger consistently)
8. Deployment runbook + SLA documentation
9. Load testing (identify DB and edge function bottlenecks)

### Phase 3: ENHANCEMENT — Post-launch backlog
10. KB vector search re-enable (embedding dimension fix + pgvector queries)
11. Chat history persistence + AI response audit trail
12. Advanced observability (APM, custom usage metrics dashboard)
13. data-sync-to-live dry-run/rollback mode (BUG-H3)

---

## Final Assessment

AI Legal Armenia is a technically sophisticated platform with excellent core legal AI functionality, mature data model, and strong security architecture. The core product works. However, it is fundamentally incomplete as a commercial SaaS — the business infrastructure layer (billing, compliance, monitoring) is entirely absent.

The gap is not in the AI or legal domain features — those are strong. The gap is in the SaaS wrapper around those features.

With 6–8 weeks of focused effort on Phase 1, this platform moves from NO_GO to CONDITIONAL_GO, suitable for controlled early adopter launch with a small cohort of law firms.

**Recommendation: Do not launch to paying customers until Phase 1 is complete. Internal testing and pilot partnerships can begin immediately.**
